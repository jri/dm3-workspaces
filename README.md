DeepaMehta 3 Workspaces Plugin
==============================

The Workspaces Plugin allows you to divide the DeepaMehta 3 knowledge base into thematic subsets.
Every topic and every relation is assigned to one or more (or no) workspaces.
By switching between workspaces you can instantly reveal subsets of your knowledge base.
For every topic DeepaMehta tells you the workspace(s) it belongs to.

Furthermore, in conjunction with the DeepaMehta 3 Email plugin (<http://github.com/jri/dm3-email>)
a workspace provides the basis for distribution emails.
